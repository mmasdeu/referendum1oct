October 1, 2017. A cronicle of many victories
==============================================

In the following lines I try to give an account of how I lived 26 hours
that I will never forget. The story is probably ver similar to that of
thousands of people who served at the polling stations of the referendum
that will lead us to achieve the Catalan Republic.

![image](entrada.jpg)

20:00 (-1)

:   We speak with the volunteers that have gathered at “Aulos”, in order
    to coordinate for the day after. Most crucially, we decide who will bring
    coffe, and how! We head home to get ready for the night. There are two
    polling places which are closed and will be so through the night:
    “Aulos” and “Espai Infantil”. They need to be protected starting at
    5:00, but there is no need to be there before. We decide to spend
    the night at “Saltells”, a school which is open and that will also
    be a polling place the day after.

20:50 (-1)

:   We leave home and head towards “Saltells”. We take sleeping bags,
    board games, food and water. We don’t take pillows or foam, out of
    our laziness. We will clearly regret it 24 hours later.

21:10 (-1)

:   At “Saltells” we find about 30 people of all ages. There is a group
    of teenagers looking forward to being able to cast their first vote,
    and there is also old people, and very old. They tell us that at 22h
    we will lock ourselves in, and that only someone that can be
    directly identified by someone inside will be let in. In this way we
    will avoid problems with possible infiltrators. Meanwhile, we have
    dinner and chat with our new acquaintances.

21:40 (-1)

:   The mayor and the vice-mayor visit us. They are stopping at all the
    schools that have been “organizing activities” through the day, to
    support the volunteers. The mayor quietly talks to two of the people
    in the room and gives them some instructions, that will remain
    secret. We get a clear impression that there is people who knows
    what needs to be done, the others simply trust them.

22:20 (-1)

:   Someone closer to the organization pays us a visit. Very quickly,
    everyone gathers around him to hear the plan (or what we can know
    about it). He literally says that we are all in a boat full of holes
    and that we are rowing as hard as we can. He tells us that wee will
    need computers and mobile devices because the organization has
    decided to use the universal census. Therefore no census lists will
    be used at the polling stations. People offers to go get computers
    and tablets (at “Saltells”, they need 5). He wishes us good luck and
    departs.

22:50 (-1)

:   We clean up and prepare the sleeping bags. Most people is not in a
    mood for partying, although the younger ones stay out to chat and
    chill out. Inside, the older people starts to think about going to
    “bed”. We have been told that at 5am we need to be ready to protect
    the school. We explain them that we plan to go to either “Aulos” or
    “Espai Infantil”, because they need more people. Therefore we set
    the alarm clock at 4am: we need to stop at home to prepare coffee,
    no excuses there.

23:30 (-1)

:   Lights are swithed off. Some of us check our phones or tables, but
    people falls asleep soon.

3:50

:   I check the time, I haven’t slept much because the floor is very
    hard. Maria isn’t sleeping either, so we decide to wake up and not
    let the alarm clock go off. We ask the key master to let us out, and
    we wish each other good luck.

4:30

:   We finish preparing the coffee and put it in a thermos. We also take
    cake and milk. Soon we head out to “Espai Infantil”.

4:45

:   We arrive at “Espai Infantil”, where we find about fifteen more
    people. A few minutes later we are many more, some coming from
    “Aulos” which apparently is better protected. We begin to realize
    that there will be enough of us. Some of what we recognize faces
    from the day before. Some others have decided to come spontaneously
    to defend their usual polling station. We see people from
    “Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona”, coming also with their
    families. The building remains locked, but someone asserts that
    “someone will come at the right time”. Again, we stay confident and
    trust the “someones”.

5:20

:   A guy riding a bicicle appears from the somewhere, and he gets among
    the crowd. Seconds later he takes the bicicle and rides away. The
    door is unlocked (!). He was wearing a hood, but I can recognize
    him. Last night he as at “Saltells”.

5:45

:   The Mossos (the Catalan police force) arrive. They ask us if there
    is anyone responsible for the gathering (the answer: *No, we were
    just “hanging out” randomly*). They check the place out and get a
    rough count of our number. They tell us that they want to rest, too,
    but that they have been told to stay there until 21h at night. They
    stay out of the building and will remain there for the whole day.

6:30

:   We have set up a table inside the building, right past the gateway.
    There are coffee thermos, milk, shortcake, and a cake that a lady
    has backed the night before –and which tastes great–. We wait and
    wait, everyone is excited and looking forward to the day.

7:30

:   A car arrives, people surrounds it (someone gets messages on the
    phone and gives us orders) because the Mossos are still there. A man
    opens the back door and comes out with must be the ballot box. He
    enters the building surrounded by people to protect him. A few
    moments later, and the car leaves. Everything has happened very
    quickly, it looks like everything is under control.

7:50

:   The tables are cleaned up, and we are asked to leave the building
    (and obviously stay to protect the gate). Inside there are only a
    few people, and one of them (later we will know who she is, but
    we’ll call her E.) asks if there is among us any of the officers. No
    one claims to be an officer (the letters notifying the officers had
    been confiscated by the Spanish police several days ago) and E.
    explains that they will repeat the question in 15 minutes. If the
    answer is the same, the law requires the first people in line to be
    asked to volunteer. I get closer to the gate, when the queue is
    formed I will be the first.

8:05

:   E. asks again if the officers are present, and as we all expected
    the three first in line are asked to volunteer. Three more people
    identify themselves as scrutineers, and we all enter the building.
    The rest of the people remains outside.

8:10

:   We are inside the building. There is C. (lawyer, she represents the
    public administration) and E. (representing the city council). There
    is also S., M. and myself. The three scrutineers are also with us.
    We are told the mechanics of the process. Someone has to act as
    “president” and S. (the eldest among us) offers himself. We are also
    told that we may face (according to the Spanish law) fines of up to
    3000 Euro each. But the Catalan law protects us.

8:30

:   We set up the table that we will be used to vote. The seals for the
    ballot box arrive (they were not there when we arrived, but things
    seem to magically appear as we need them. It’s great!). I ask Maria
    to fetch the computer from home, since we will need it. She tells me
    to take good care of it, since there are a lot of pictures that we
    haven’t yet backed up. Ten minutes later we have the computer with
    us.

8:55

:   We are ready, in 5 minutes we will be told the website that we will
    use to check the IDs. We are all ready and excited with the day that
    awaits us.

9:00

:   We open polling station. There is a long queue of people waiting to
    vote (basically, those who were protecting the station). We type in
    the proper IP and password. But it looks like the website doesn’t
    work, the page is not loading. This had been foreseen, there had
    been plenty of attacks in the previous days and it was clear that
    this would continue through the day. We need a new IP address, but
    in order to obtain it we need to call a phone number, which is
    located in the UK. They don’t answer the call –of course, all other
    polling stations are doing the same–.

9:15

:   We have been unsuccessfully calling, none of the stations have
    managed to register IDs either. One of the stations managed to
    register the first votes a while ago, but we are still out of luck.
    There is no way to contact the agents that will provide us with the
    passwords.

9:55

:   We are told that they are printing census lists, to be used as a
    last resource. The problem is that this cannot be mixed with the
    electronic registry, and it’s unclear how to coordinate both. C.
    decides (following the orders of the county coordinators) to not use
    these lists, at least for now.

12:00

:   We are still stalled. We have been trying three or four IPs, after
    the phone numbers have been progressively disappearing as well.
    Outside the building there is a huge queue, but people is extremely
    patient. We have allowed them to wait inside the building (not the
    room) because outside it’s raining quite hard. We have been updating
    them with what is going on. There is a very old lady that needs help
    to walk, she has come with her assistant. She will be the first to
    vote, once this is possible. She doesn’t leave, after all the time
    she has waited so far she is really determined to vote.

12:15

:   Finally we have got a new password, and proceed to check the ID of
    the elderly lady. After waiting for more than a minute, the website
    answers with a green box that the ID is correct. And the first vote
    is casted! We try the second ID, that of the assistant to the lady.
    The website doesn’t give a reply, and finally we decide that she
    will go back home to take care of the lady, she can come later.

13:10

:   I see a sandwich next to the table. I recognize the reusable
    wrapping as coming from home, and I’m told that Maria has brought it
    a while ago. I hadn’t noticed until now: the three of us at the
    table have been very busy all this time, we didn’t see anything
    except from voters, IDs and ballots.

14:00

:   During all this time we have been managing quite well. There is
    still a large queue, but the cadency is good. About 200 hundred votes
    have already been casted –the census for this station is about 1100
    people–. Many people takes photos of each other casting their votes,
    they get emotional. It’s easy to spot tears in the eyes. A
    middle-aged man says “That’s to you, mom” while casting his vote.
    There are families with their kids, they cast their parents’ vote
    while the parents take a picture that will probably become
    historical. There is old people, many of them. And many people thank
    us for what we are doing as they cast the vote. We always reply that
    it’s thanks to themselves that they can vote today. We have been
    provided with coffee and food through the morning, and someone
    brought in two roasted chicken (I should have warned them before
    that I’m vegetarian). Luckily the sandwich turns out to be great
    tasting!

14:30

:   We have managed to almost eliminate the queue. It seems that the
    problem is now to guarantee that there is enough people around the
    polling station. We have information leaked from the (catalan)
    police that assures that if they see less than 20 people they will
    take us out and lock the building down. A call is broadcast to all
    Cerdanyola (through the Whatsapp groups) to send people to prevent
    this from happening, and we manage to quickly increase the numbers
    of supporters.

15:15

:   It looks like the websites have stopped working once more. Queues
    form again, and we tell the voters what happened during the morning,
    so that they are aware that they may be facing a long wait. No one
    leaves. We keep trying phone numbers that keep popping up like
    mushrooms (we have about 10 such numbers), and the sheet of paper
    where we write down the IPs and passwords can’t fit more of them. C.
    is the one in charge of the passwords, and she gets stressed out
    with all this. Obviously she has all of our support, and keeps
    trying.

16:10

:   We are up and running! The website that we are using now works
    slightly different. Instead of having to log in at the beginning,
    the browser sends the login details each time that an ID is
    registered. This way, if we need to change the IP we will be able to
    use the same password –a very intelligent move!–. In order to speed
    up the data entry (now in addition to the voter’s ID, one has to
    enter the ID of the polling station as well as the password) I
    activate the password manager in my browser. The mechanics are quite
    straightforward: the voter produces his ID, I introduce it in the
    corresponding field and click a button. After a few seconds there is
    a response. Sometimes I need to refresh the website and try again.
    To test the system we have introduced a repeated ID and the system
    has responded with a red box. We have also detected some people who
    was not in the census, and asked them to leave without voting. Once
    validated, I pass the ID on to M., and his job is to write it down
    in the voters’ registry. The president, S., allows the vote to be
    casted.

16:50

:   The county electoral coordinators inform us that the Spanish Police
    has taken some ballot boxes. We are told to take action, so we tell
    the voters to leave the room in order to discuss what to do next. C.
    thinks that we should save the votes already casted (we have
    registered about 430 so far). The possible plan is the following: we
    will break the seal that protects the box, and we will put all the
    votes in a rubish bag, which we will seal. We know the owner of a
    building in front of the polling station, and we are trying to
    contact him to let us hide the votes inside, who will be kept by M.
    until scrutiny time. The president thinks that we shouldn’t do it.
    But M. and myself believe that it is better to preserve the votes
    rather than let all the effort that the people has made until then
    to be wasted. Therefore, by majority it is decided to break the
    seal. M. takes the rubish bag together with other items that will
    serve to distract. We won’t see him until 20h. Both S. and myself
    will have to work harder for the remaining hours. We open again and
    let the voters in. One of them is angry about all the time he has
    had to wait. It is the one exception in a day where everyone
    understands whose fault this is.

17:35

:   People keeps voting, a voter asks if we have had too much trouble
    with the boxes –there are rumours about other stations– and we are
    in control. We don’t say anything about the empty box, but people
    doesn’t ask. They can tell that our goal is to collect the opinion
    of the people. More people comes, and the online system seems to be
    working quite well now. It seems that some polling stations have
    used the census lists (which were printed at 10am seeing how the
    online servers were failing, but C. rejected to use them. It would
    have deligitimated the vote, since it would become almost impossible
    to prevent duplicate voting). Much later, close to midnight, I will
    learn that some polling stations were not nearly as scrupulous. A
    pity, but it’s understandable.

18:45

:   More rumours about the Spanish Police about to come. I’m very
    nervous, we let very few people to remain in the polling room for
    safety. The most critical moment in the day is getting closer.

19:40

:   Only 20 minutes left, there is people who finished working and comes
    last minute. A mother with a baby on a carrier. A group of teenagers
    that looks like they make the decision last minute. A group of
    youngsters with angry faces causes the volunteers to enter the room
    to protect it from possible tensions. The four of them (three blokes
    and a girl) get close to the table, and hand the IDs out. I fear
    that they will throw the box to the floor, maybe hit the computer.
    But nothing like this happens, the IDs register as valid, they cast
    their votes and they leave.

20:00

:   We lock ourselves in, again. The last vote has ben cast at 19:55, a
    young lady who was so happy to have managed to get there in time.
    Now it’s time for the scrutiny, and we don’t want anyone –especially
    police– in. Outside, the large group of people that will protect us.
    The third official, M., appears with the bag full of votes.
    Everything is working fine.

20:15

:   We start the scrutiny. The first that we do is to break the seal
    that protects the bag, and empty the contents inside the ballot box,
    as they should. We carefully check that no ballot is left in the
    bag. We count the votes and there is one missing. During the second
    counting, we find a ballot without envelope that was hidden between
    two envelopes. In total, 517 votes have been cast. All of us work on
    opening the envelopes and we place them in three piles: Yes, No and
    Blank. The invalid ones are set apart. We find a clear “Yes” with
    the extra text: “Por tí, mamá. Por tí, papá” (To you, mom. To you,
    dad). It’s a shame that it will have to be considered invalid, but
    these are the rules. Another one says “Rajoy y Puigdemont,
    dimisión”. Someone else has written “Sí” (Yes) inside the Yes box,
    this will be counted as valid. At the end, there are 433 Yes, 59 No,
    9 invalid and 16 blank.

20:52

:   We finish signing the reports. People cheers us from outside. We
    need to wait for the other polling stations to finish. The goal is
    to arrive at the city council with the reports, and we are afraid of
    infiltrators trying to get them. C. hides them under her T-shirt,
    and puts on a jacket as well to disguise them. The other stations
    are finishing, and columns of people are formed. We will join them
    as they pass by our street (we are the last station, since we are
    the closest to the council). When they arrive. No one other than the
    eight of us in the room knows who is actually carrying the reports.

21:20

:   We will ask those waiting outside to protect “us”. We won’t specify
    who is “us”, they will know since they have seen “us” around for the
    whole day. An infiltrator wouldn’t know this. We open the door and
    we leave all together. The ballot box (with the scrutinized votes)
    will stay in the room, locked, as has been decided last minute. We
    place ourselves among the others, and I particularly feel very well
    protected by the volunteers that have spent the whole day with us,
    who get closer. Although I feel very safe, the eight who know who
    carries the reports keep a discrete eye on her. Outside the street,
    lots of victory chants, lots of “Hem Votat!” (“we have just voted”,
    an evolution of the “We will vote” that was used in the past weeks),
    and the “No volem ser…” (beginning of a popular independentist
    song). There is people in the balconies cheering us. We are lots of
    people, many hundreds, walking towards the council. Most of the
    people around us started the day at 5am or earlier, in front of some
    of the several polling stations.

21:35

:   We arrive in front of the city council. C. disappears and we know
    she has manged: all the votes from “Espai Infantil” will join the
    global count. The mayor gives a short speech and the loudspeakers
    start transmitting the sound from the Catalan radio. I listen to the
    words of Jordi Cuixart (leader of Omnium Cultural), and suddenly I
    feel the need to see my family again.

21:55

:   I get home. The day is over, but I will find it very hard to be able
    to sleep after such a day. We set the TV on and the violent images
    of the police attacks hit me hard. Slowly, the joy and excitement
    turns into anger and sadness. Unfortunately, the shameful actions of
    a rotten regime will overtake tomorrow the headlines of all
    newspapers. We won’t forget, and we won’t forgive.

Marc.
